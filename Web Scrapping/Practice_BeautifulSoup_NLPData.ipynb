Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.',\n",

You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome...Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging...The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant)...Cons:..1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears...2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger...Well, I\\'ve never tried the iPhone before and I\\'m using this for the first time (Yes, I\\'m already using other apple products like MacBook Air &amp; Pro)...But the product is great and I\\'m just lovin it.\\n...',\n",

I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller..This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces..My loss is 60000 rs.

       " \"<span>\\n  This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!.Now, off to the device...Pros.The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal..Speakers sound better than my previous phone..A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!.OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work..Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either...Cons.Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced..Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them..No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones...Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.\",\n",

You guys have more or less better gadget..2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS...Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11..1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week..2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion..3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max..4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max..5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing..6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11.

       " '<span>\\n  I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good..Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!.The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed..Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how)..So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.',\n",

Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11..Horrible experience with #Amazon. 😭.Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone.

       " '<span>\\n  My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I\\'ll just list out a few points regarding the phone:.Pros:.A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated].The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020].Somewhere between great to excellent battery life.The software experience is great if you\\'re into \"apple way\" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC.The phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it\\'s sides are alluminium and not steel...Cons:.Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there\\'s just no escaping that fact..You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text..The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she\\'s not a tech geek and she\\'s loving the purple color and the camera of the phone..And also if you\\'re into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process...Conclusion with personal thoughts:.Overall the phone is a great one if you\\'re not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It\\'s also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  This is phone is amazing!.Face ID : responsive and super save!!.Camera: It’s the best feature of this phone! Really good camera..Display: it’s still good! When compared to a one plus 7 and 8. It’s just brighter but it’s not sharper.If you want the best display in the game go for 11 pro...I have no complaints on this',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Pros:.Camera quality is 09/10..Display 09/10.Battery life 10/10.Heating issue : I face no heating issue.Product genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original..Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt..Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Phenomenal is the word , apple finally clicks in India with its predatory pricing and top notch feature which makes it hard to let go...The battery is running strong and the added extra camera is a plus. Apple you aced this one.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller &amp; delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised &amp; in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage -.Pros.1. Premium feel at hand &amp; ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user..2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps..3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced..4. Face ID works like charm &amp; very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen..5. Call quality, data connection &amp; connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone...Cons.1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided..2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors...Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Not rating right now..But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario...The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty...One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time..I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year...He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair...So here i am writing this...First two days review.Battery life ok.Camera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg).Face id good.Interface once u get everything its hard to not track everything.Rest everything is typical apple.Con.Phone is heavy hahaha.Ill try to keep updating....Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrs.I have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming apps.Only work and paytm and banking apps.With social media apps excluding facebook',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The only apple product i can buy with the money left in my account is Apple juice.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  PROS :.1. Excellent phone with sleek screen.2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day.3. Face recognition is smooth.CONS:.1. Just the exchange process is very very complex.If you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps..1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange.2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away.3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number..4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same..5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone..6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email..7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device..8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away..9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT..10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service..I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone...SUMMARY:.GREAT PHONE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CALL CENTER FOLKS, GREAT EXCHANGE PRICE. BUT EXTREMELY TOUGH EXCHANGE PROCESS.',\n",

What else to say... feeling cheated......After one month......Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.\\n.',\n",

It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them.

       " \"<span>\\n  I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!..This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:.1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker..2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer..3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems..That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13...I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review...First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones...Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones...User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out...Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well...Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome...Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed...earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent...Overall user experience:.Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11..Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent..Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints..Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either..Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain..2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all..3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here...One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it...Hope this review helps next buyer.\",\n",

This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal..On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism..Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised..Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D..And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand...I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again..Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:..&gt; My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone.&gt; THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id..&gt; There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up.&gt; Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone.&gt;I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess..&gt; I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Reviewing after a month’s use.....Pros:.- Great battery life: My usage is mainly calls, mails, WhatsApp, podcasts, web browsing and social media.- Satisfied with Apple’s claims about security and privacy.- Works great within the apple ecosystem. Already have an iPad and AirPods and connections are seamless across products.- Great for work and productivity.- Siri Shortcuts is great for creating workflows.Cons:.- Not great for media consumption. Screen resolution is a little over 720p.- Camera is great. But as of now I haven’t been able to use it to click better photos than I did on my previous phone (OnePlus 7). I don’t know, Maybe I’m using the camera wrong :P.- Had to buy the charger separately :(.- Lacks notification control to the extent that I want. In android I could have rules for different notifications within the same app, not possible here..Had bought it out of peer pressure to be honest...So I’m having mixed feelings about it.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Phone is great but I am really disappointed by amazon service. It was applicable for bonus 1 offer and I was suppose to get cashback of 1250 and an executive said expect it by wednesday but when it dint credit on chking with amazon executive again they said its not applicable!.There was no stars or mentioned in FAQs that iphone is not applicable for bonus..Felt like wrong advertisement, cheated and really disappointed by amazon offers and services. Been amazon customer for years and this experience is really very disappointing. Feels like lost the trust in amazon :( Wrong advt and incorrect offers was just never expected from amazon!\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  After 3 months of usage, It feels smooth and it’s the first time I’ve used an IOS device. Following are few points describing the product..1) Screen and display:.The screen is quite comfortable to look at and the adaptive display works excellent. The transition from one app to another is so smooth and satisfying. The display adapts according to lighting and quite easy on the eyes. There’s blue light filter (true tone) which gives a warm hue to the display. Brightness when set to max is excellent even in day light..Update: The phone is dust proof and waterproof and underwater pictures are phenomenal. No need to worry if you dropped your phone in water..2) Software:.Currently on IOS 14, the interface is to a next level. It took few days to adapt according to the interface but now, every app is smooth and easy to use..The face unlock is so accurate as it uses infrared light and smart unlock. That means no one can unlock your phone while you’re asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot’s of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security! Each and every bit of data is safe on your device..3) battery.As I’m not a heavy gamer, the battery is enough for an entire day or 2 at max. Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple’s 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you’re a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging..4) camera.Well it’s iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you’re into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone’s camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid..Few cons of the device.1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don’t find it annoying but few people may..2) Phone may heat a little during charging..3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out..First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍\\xa0 for that..Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one..✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry..✅ All-day battery life..✅ A great degree of water &amp; dust resistance..✅ Wireless charging.✅ An extra ultra-wide camera.✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio &amp; Airtel provide this for now).✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features..But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical...A high recommendation for this product.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  It's a really bad buying experience from Amazon as they are not giving Amazon pay cashback as stated by their offer. Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting finer details of terms and conditions during the offer in so many places that it’s impossible to take screenshots of complete offer and it’s serve the purpose for amazon  tactically as you cant have all details handy with you when you will complain with their customer care regarding not receiving the cashback. usually cashback come to the customer account only after sales end, So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways...Soon it seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now...BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images taken from the iPhone is no doubt is best in the segment and hard for any phone to match that. But as per my experience It's better to buy it offline after checking it personally, spending few thousand bucks makes much more sense rather risking much larger amount. I am lucky phone comes out as original but I have heard about many fraud cases from both Amazon and Flipkart. So choose wisely\",\n",

I was confused between mint green &amp; this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural &amp; true to life.

Very loudly sound and every beats are crisp and clear..Camera quality are awesome no doubt. Display quality is decent  and battery life is also decent. Approx 1 day uses with normal uses. Face id is more secure. But i got face one issue. In this Pandemic, the mask has to come down again and again whenever the phone has to be unlocked. So they should give In fingerprint displays. This is safe feature in this pandemic..Along with the phone, they should also provide a charger. Because you take so much money, you still cannot provide charger, even that big company!.Overall the phone is good, you can buy.\\n.\",\n",

Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care can’t connect with a person and their automated options doesn’t cover my concern..Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.',\n",

Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei.4. Boot the phone and wait for \"Apple logo to load\" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy.5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock.6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides.7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaults..What did I like about this phone?.1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced).2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features.3.

Video quality is good though...Battery: It’s not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly.

Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom.

       " '<span>\\n  iPhone11 Review. A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I  thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features..  One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking..  Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing..  Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone..  Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier..  Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but,  my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.\\n.',\n",

Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.

Seemed like a great deal. The camera out of box was glitchy. I wasn able to click photos since it was constantly changing focus. But after the 3gb ios 15 update things are perfect.

If the damage happened because of pressure damage the black spot should not have disappeared. I have spoken to iphone center they are not giving proper response.

       " '<span>\\n  First of all a very big thank you to Amazon great Indian sale as I bought this device for 46,249 and I really did not expect that I would get iPhone 11 at this price I’m truly very happy that I could wait all this long to buy a new phone. Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years..Well I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality..No let’s talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage &amp; I am really a heavy user..Camera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it’s a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn’t give the best quality &amp; filed of view..Talking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it..I don’t know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a “WOW”.The face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn’t work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best..Now talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes..Talking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn’t break..Talking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it..So I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won’t be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery........I was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it’s a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; 🤞🏼I really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn’t face any issue in terms of packaging.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Had preordered it arrived at the same day when it was officially out on retail store. Prompt delivery and with excellent packaging. Been using a few days and for me it’s an excellent upgrade from 7 to 11. Full review I will be dropping later after few days of regular usage. N I love the pastel green color 😊',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  So after reading 3-4 negative review I thought to not buy a premium phone on Amazon but I am seriously telling you not to consider these 3-4 negative review,so finally I ordered I phone 11 for my son and phone is doing great ,no problems are faced till now,and also I contacted amazon customer care executive they told me mam if you faced any problem call directly to us we will surely help you ,iam honestly telling you amazon is the best online shopping flatform ,they treat you like a family member , so overwhelming thank you amazon',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android..Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system..Hope with new release they will match with android..Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don’t even think of it.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  +ve:.Battery.Performance.FaceLock..-ve.Display (Its not AMOLED but its okay).Only 5GB cloud space free. (I believe in android it had 15 GB you can move to google photos or one drive as an alternative measure)..Consider before Buying:.No Finger Print Sensor.Inbox charger is 5W ( But phone supports 18W).Charger Cable Quality (Not worse but could be better).Dual Sim (ESIM + Normal Physical Sim) --&gt; ESIM is not available in BSNL other network has..PUBG with high settings causes heat on the phone. ( Its normal however the battery is good when compared to android).All application sizes will be very huge when compared to Android. (might be 10x than android so plan ur capacity need).Buy Temper glass &amp; Case while purchasing or before using the phone to avoid scratches...Issue with seller:.The IMEI doesnt matches with the bill they have provided I am yet to get the update from Amazon.Out of 2 IMEI one matches and the other doesnt matches.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Amazon and appario retail did a good job..I received a apple factory sealed package...But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service...Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I was very much worried when I ordered this phone from Amazon sale cuz of so many negative reviews  n grabbed it in 44k around. When I unboxed it and check warranty along with every possible detail I found it to be a superb phone at a jaw dropping price. My phone has no heating issue or camera issue or whatever issue these guys have mentioned in reviews. All over a great deal. Just go for it blindly as it’s still cheaper than what u get in offline store.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Front camera not good. Even both the camera front and back is not having that much quality. Picture is spread to the corners of selfie camera just like a ordinary phone. Heating problem is also persist if you use phone continuous of more than half an hour for any application such as YouTube listening music etc. I feel that Amazon provide customer first copy and not the original iPhone 11. Someone has to address this issue. Feeling is not good. I see the pictures captures by the front camera in google and seems very different than captured in my iPhone 11.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  There’s no complaint regarding software side as it is fluid as always..It is an iPhone so all the pros are there which we see in an iPhone..However, in 2021, it severely lacks behind in some department. Like the screen quality. It’s a good screen but seeing the competition it lacks a bit now. And feels dated too. Main camera sensor is very good. It struggles a bit in ultra wide in night only..My main conn is it’s been just one year and my battery health fell down to 87%. Which I think is a bit more than what I expected. So it used to get me through the day one year ago but now it’s almost 10-15% at the end of the day. That too at moderate use. I do not play games in this..It now tends to warm a bit too during browsing and using camera but not raising concerns..Large pdfs however crashes in between the scrolls. It might be software issue since I have now seen any lag elsewhere so I’m not blaming A13 Bionic for that..64 gb for me felt pretty sufficient and I’ve only reached half the memory till now..iPhone 11 is still a good phone especially until the 5G arrives. It is priced at 32k in great indian sale which according to me is an insane deal even now. For someone who wants to shift to iOS but are tight on budget I recommend them to go with this even in 2021 as it is an all rounder in every aspect.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Me a ten year android user finally switched to iOS and this was a deal which couldn’t be refused. About iPhone everything is great. Just two cons comparatively less battery back up if you coming from 5000/6000mAH android phones and screen has a bit of yellow tint but it can be resolved from settings. So overall 8.5/10 for the phone.',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it...Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days..The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone..2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone..The Battery backup is decent..The Sound Quality is nice..Face recognition is really fast..Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life..Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts..Hope this helps ! ✌🏼\\n.\",\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  Dear Amazon Support/Customer Care,..This ls to write and bring to your notice regarding the extremely bad quality of product and support provided by Amazon...To brief you about the situation, I bought an apple iphone-11 from Amazon and not from any other platform because of the trust on Amazon and it's great support team. But this time around, it was a completely opposite situation. After receiving the product on 30.10.2020, the product was discolored ( like damage); I immediately tried to replace the product through the options available on the app, but the app would just direct me back to the link of apple support website and contact number. After several tries, I final got through the apple support, only to be redirected to the apple store. On reaching the apple Stores during the limited stringent work hours, I was asked to come the next day. On the next day, I was informed that this issue needs to be taken up by Amazon only...After being extremely tired of this entire long process, with great difficulty, I could connect with the Amazon customer support. The customer support assured me of resolving the issue and asked me to wait for 24 hours to get a call...Post this, it has already been more than 40 hours and I m yet to receive any call. Furthermore, when I am trying to call the same number, I fail to connect despite repeated tries. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of your product and support; which is least expected from Amazon...Today being my last day of eligible replacement, I write to you with the Last hope of some relief...I expect atleast this time around Amazon will help its long loyal customer, who is losing faith in the quality of Amazon.\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  My sister uses 12 and I tell you there's no difference other than 12 hold better in hand. I still like 11 over 12 or 13, Apple now sells it for 49999 after 13 launch, I bought it before launch at 55999.

To all those naysayers comparing Android with iOS, I have just one thing to say - Use iOS once and then we’ll see who comes out trumps. Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, iOS 14.1, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all. My Phone - iPhone🙂',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it...Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it...Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup...Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance...There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem...I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify...For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge...The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour...PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too\",\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Pros -.1. All the benefits of an iPhone. (Superb ios experience, smoothness, speed, touchscreen etc etc etc).2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage..3. Sound is loud...Cons:-.1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ₹1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you..2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold..Iphone x - 174 gms.Iphone xs - 177 gms.Iphone 11 - 193.3 gms.Iphone 12 - 162.4 gms',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying...I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios...I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months...Build quality is remarkable...IOS 14 is a magic...Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size...Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X...I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple...Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples..If you are a photo person, this one is for you...Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  😅..This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life...Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps...Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected..Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging...Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍',\n",

Long WhatsApp messages get truncated.3. The call log cannot store all calls. It stores only last 1000. Also, it does not consolidate the calls of a single caller..4. Screen is good. Mine is functioning well with minute scratches after 10+ months of usage.5. Speaker phone volume is low.6. Ringtone volume is low. Missed so many calls if someone is on the move.7. No support on third party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook or Adobe\\n.',\n",

So let’s talk about camera I would say bang on camera so good quality pictures in low light or in dark. In terms of performance phone nailed in that but only one problem I think I must include here is if you play PUBG or any heavy game like that phone heats not that much but it heats everyone is here complaining about heating problems trust me phone not heat while normal usage only when you play heavy graphics game like PUBG cod fort nite. So that’s all .',\n",

It was always good but after usage of 8 months I am facing this issue, if the sale was made on intention then the company must vanish here on. Also it is under 1 year warranty, I need to know who will bear this cost',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  People who buy it why they are getting it so I will only come to help you make a better decision..1. You will have pay addition money 2k for the charger..2. Many things like sharing stuff will only work with only apple devices..3. This is quite strange but I found Samsung one ui gesture control better then iPhone..4. Not a HD screen and notch could bother some people..5. Face ID doesn’t work with masks.6. I having windows laptop which doesn’t have usb c, there is no way to sync with iTunes. Without spending more in a convertor..7. Camera has no quality setting for still images..These are the few things that bothered in witching few days of purchasing it.\\n..',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Front camera quality in not good at all..And dual sim doesn’t support in the phone..This is not a dual sim device because only one sim works at once...Like if u r call from primary sim then secondary sim becomes like no service...And the same goes with the secondary sim..Even u can’t receive messages if u r on the call..If u received a call from unknown number on sim 2..And u want to call to that number from sim one that’s not gonna happen..For that u have to save that unknown number then only u will be able to call on that number',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  iPhone is known for their industry leading camera performances. iPhone 11 is a great phone. A lot of  reviews out there , I don't have much to talk about. It's camera is absolutely fantastic. Nice battery backup. But when I charge it with the 20 watt power adaptor it slightly heats up the phone. That's not a big concern. It's just slightly and if you don't want that then you could use a 12 watt power adaptor as a solution. It's still a good phone in 2021 . So I highly recommend this if you want to buy .\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  iPhone - the name is enough to guarantee buttery smooth performance, with years of guaranteed OS updates (Android, looking at you. I struggled to get the monthly updates for weeks on your own brand Pixel phones, forget about the flashy Samsung and Xiaomi/OnePlus etc.). Amazing camera, no bloatware or selling customer data to third parties (again Android, looking at you. You give the OS for free and make the customer the product to push ads for revenue). After years of being a committed Android user, from the time Nokia/Microsoft stopped making Windows smartphones, for almost 6+years, finally decided being taken for a ride by Google/Android. Well, was using the iPhone 6s for about an year along with my Google Pixel 2 XL, but now Apple iPhone is my only daily driver, and the way things are looking between Apple and Google and how they are focused on business in India, its going to be an iPhone always for me, for the foreseeable future.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone...I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!..Pros:.1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor.2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal.3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud.4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!..Cons:.1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging.2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate.3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.\\n.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  No comments on apple product.Pros:.1. Rich finishing.2. Awesome battery life .You will get two days for normal usage. For hard users it will be one day strongly.3. Marvellous photography using iPhone 11. Portrait mode is more attractive compare to previous versions. Wide angle camera Adds more attraction to the phone as well as more convenient while taking pictures.Night mode is awesome..4.front camera is very nice.5.performance wise A13 chip never lags You in any instance..6.Finally the brand value Apple Apple apple. I got this phone at the better price in 47999.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performance.The only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively..If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money option.Display is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I have received a defective Product,When I switched it on I got some vertical lines displayed in center of the screen.I have tried to replace the product,But no response from Amazon , Simply says we need to contact Iphone Customer care.I don't know just received one day phone,I have to keep on spending my time to iphone customer care.This is a bad experience which I have ever got in Amazon. Amazon makes sure that should not be repeat this in future.Otherwise Amazon wil leads to drop their trust and customers in future.\",\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!.Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double..Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more....Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give “amazing user experience” then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards...Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.🤘.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Phone is stylish and i am first time apple user .its look good and it would be too early to comment as i got the phone today only. I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.  I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later.

       " '<span>\\n  Superb. It’s a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don’t think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can’t multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Mobile device is good. Good upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected.  I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn’t hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Easily the best overall mobile phone for nearly two years now, and with good reason. Gifted a purple one to my mother. She was using a Oneplus X for a few years, and she loves the 11. The transition from android was smoother than expected. iOS and iPhone have come a long way from the days of iPhone 6...Pros: that battery, that camera, iOS, Apple care...Cons: are you kidding me?..OK, if I had to nitpick, the only annoying thing about iOS is having to use Garage Band to make my own ringtones from songs..Otherwise, it's a pleasure to use this phone each time you pick it up.\",\n",

It’s camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge.

       " '<span>\\n  Here’s my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great..WiFi reception is Average I would say..Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crisp.The speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love it.The display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurate.Battery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day..The phone is slippery so I use a back case..Nothing more to say about i0S and it’s updates they are great',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :..Positives:.Price Point : Brought this at ₹46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival..Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chip.Secure : You close your eyes and face id won\\'t unlock your phone..Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editing.Gaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes..Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here...What i Dislike:.Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of \"Budget iPhone\" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ₹68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ₹23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series...I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money...This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way...Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)..Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)..Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)\",\n",

But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed..Pros:.Battery.Camera.Display.Processor..Cons:.The charger provided is only of 5W...Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing.

One thing which I was expecting was to control shutter speed atleast in the night mode settings it only gives me pre defined options..Display: 4/5 even though you wont be able to see individual pixels, still would have been a tad better it the pixel density was little more atleast better than xr.Performance: 5/5 No doubt every iphone release breaks the previous record',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  bro if you are Android user and you love Android then don't buy iPhone,because in iPhone you will not get any customisation and you will have to to see listen music online you can download it offline in wynk music or any other music app..if you can listen online everything then it's ok, YouI can buy this iPhone for better camera quality awesome software experience like fast UI but not best customisable software, because you can't Tweak iPhone..battery is really poor so whatever if you want to buy then buy it - for Showing off iPhone Logo..otherwise I will say you will get better phone in Android so if you want to buy any Android then go for Android because you will get lots of storage and better camera is also Android camera is really good above 50k Indian rupees\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Good one',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Again editing my review after using it for almost 2 weeks, initially, on call volume was soo low that on every call i had to put on speaker but that problem solved itself. So phone is doing great till now . Only thing is charging adapter comes only of 5w which is charging very slow, so had to buy 12w adapter separately. Overall happy with product',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I have been using 6s for past ~5yrs and made an economical swicth to Iphone 11, to stick to the simplified OS. For god sake, I could see so many cons in comparison with 6s, regretting my upgrade.1. Heavy!, expected, when I have switched from 6s, but its too heavy when compared to other phones of this size. May the same reason, ip12 is lighter.2. WIFI reception. ip6s did a very good job. almost at every part of my house, it was able to gather good signal. but ip11 literally struggles to even stay connected with WIFI at corners. it makes continuous switch between WIFI/cellular, annoys to to move to a different location. tried even with out the cover on..3. Speakers at the bottom. I was thinking both the grill openings at the bottom were speakers. it turned out, i could hear music from only one of them. even i have planned to visit apple care to get the mobile checked. had some instinct to check it online before going, by then i was able find in apple discussions, that its microphone with speaker like grill..4. Sound output - both through wired/wireless headphones. i could not hear anything in an crowded environment.  even tried with multiple good earphones, the output is very low. this even a low end phone can do a better job. this might force me to move to a new phone may be..And most imp is the call history, you cannot have more than 100 call records.. not sure, why apple have this policy. you gonna really miss some imp numbers, when we really get busy with continuous calls. And you cannot record your voice calls, when it’s really needed like in other ecosystem!.Feel, these are very basic setback to even consider it as a good phone. would definately not recommend anyone for ip11, rather would recommend ip12(if one can afford) or ip6s, if they could find in second hand market.(Yes, the size is small, but that does a better job). Even the former one, I'm not sure, as I haven't used hands-on.\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product..I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience...Pros:.1. Superb processor-  My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth.2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode.3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient.4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date.5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applications..Cons:.1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone.2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores.3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still..4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited..5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc...Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Most pathetic and worst service from Amazon , I got a damaged product , iPhone 11 product I received was having damaged microphone and I confirmed the same from apple authorised service centre. After several escalation calls to Amazon customer representative, they committed on call that they will provide replacement of product and later they said Amazon technician will visit my place and inspect the product but the technician did not visit my place and customer representative finally says we will only refund and not replacement. After making the customer wait for 1 week , this is what they come up. Darshit Electronics cheats people by saying they don’t have mobile phone when asked for replacement of a damaged product but they have mobile phones to sell for other customers!!! Low level......Worst experience!!',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Not much to write about an iphone. This is my 1st iphone and i was hesitant to switch to ios from android. But im glad i did. U get the cream experience of everything on the phone , camera ,sound ,screen ,os , security.

Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!.Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!.Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won’t regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :).About the battery life, it’s not bad but it’s not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!',\n",

This product comes with iPhone and cable that’s all rest adapter against cable and earphone you need to purchase separately (3000/-). Additional cost which you anyways bears for any new phone on back screen guards, screen guard for 1500/- . So please add an additional value to 5k as well when you are purchasing this phone.😄',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  After few months of waiting and research about which phone would suit me the best, I bought this in 2020...I think there isn’t a single phone that would work for everyone, they all have different expectations and needs. I was looking for a phone that’s water resistant, takes really good videos, has powerful processing, has better than average battery life, has magnetic sensor for better navigation and provides good user experience while using the phone. Stereo speakers was an add-on. Basically, this phone has fulfilled all my expectations.',\n",

Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZON.Coming to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT..The phone is incredibly beautiful..Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice..Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon..Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this..With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter..Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud..Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage..The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches...Will be updating more with coming days.......🙂',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  I had iPhone 6s and it’s been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this.  unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.',\n",

Now Let’s come to product see if you thinking about switching on android to ios then absolutely go for it really very good experience of apple. worth product and also some peoples worried about LCD display panel bt believe me the display of iPhone 11 is just amazing even you can’t notice that you are using LCD panel that  was I experience from shifting k20’s super amoled display to 11’s lcd panel and about battery no need it’s enough for daily users thank you amazon.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one...Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone...The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid..The screen size is really cool...The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd...The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w...Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I generally don't prefer to buy any expensive electronic gadgets like iPhone from any e-commerce portal. I read many negative comments from the reviews section. My plan was to buy iPhone11 128 Gig and particularly Yellow color. I checked the Amazon Sale price and the market price and the difference was 5k INR. I still wanted to buy from the nearest apple authorized retailer but there was some technical issue with the HDFC card and I could not buy it. Then after thinking so much, I tried to buy from Amazon sale on 16th-Oct-2020. The iPhone arrives and I checked the product is fully compliance and 100% genuine. I got full 1 year apple warranty and the product model number. And the best thing is my iPhone is Make in India. I am loving it :) ...\",\n",

Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it’s mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it’s little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it ...If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel..Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,.Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions..Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation..After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste..Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down..Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested..Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price..IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.\\n..\",\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  First of I would like to share my experiences after placed order of Iphone 11 128 GB black mobile in sale with discount price..I was worry about product quality nd delivery because lots of negative reviews seen on YouTube nd also in this platform..Some people claimed that they received fake products or defective products so I was also lill bit tense ..I placed this order dated 19.01.21 nd got my iphone 11 22nd morning , for precaution I done recording delivery process nd unboxing too ..Now I can say that people shouldn't doubt on Amazon and their products which they deliver..My primary phone is iPhone 12 Pro Max nd this one is my secondary phone because it's size matters for me , very handy 6.1 inch screen size so it's comfortable to use single hand ..Quality is best , battery life 100% nd camera quality is also becnchmark of this segment..Warranty is now active when activate phone..😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇\\n..\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Upgraded from iPhone 6s, I am totally happy with my new iPhone 11. Everything meets perfection on Apple as always, and the Camera is exceptional. Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app...Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise...PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Apple - another masterpiece. Camera is so real followed by powerful processor. Such a superior experience so far. Hope this continues!..Amazon - Delivery in less than 24 hours, you just nailed this prime thingi. Although i followed up, but you fullfilled your promise as usual. Kudos and thanks for delivering the device in such a perfect way... thank you...',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus...It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.',\n",

I was very apprehensive about shifting to iOS as I was told android is much more flexible and I will not be able to adjust to Apple. My phone got delivered before time, I charged it and started using it by afternoon. Took a couple of hours for data transfer and by evening I was completely in love with this phone. Was amazed by the interface and no nonsense whatsoever kind of vibe from this phone. I also got it at a very reasonable price from amazon shopping festival. Thank you Amazon and Apple !',\n",

However if it had OLED, it would be much more battery efficient..This is first time for me to have an iphone as recently I switched from android. I am switching from k20 pro that had OLED and 90 Hz display. Honestly 60 Hz is the only thing on this phone that bugged me else screen is brilliant. Gaming is fire smooth..Camera is too damn good. Extremely detailed to be precise. I have never used the camera of a phone before this much. Night mode pictures are clearly to fall in love with. If you buy quick charger you are then set to use it. Battery is really good but 5W charger is definitely not helping, earphones are also good.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  This Is My First Apple Device In my Life So I am Sharing Experience..First Of all this device has premium quality design . And best user experience , camera quality is great if you want best photos like DSLR Then just go for it . The security is always top notch in apple devices so chill and use it freely . The battery backup is also good. The best but not the least thing I like about this smartphone is audio the speaker sound of this device is awesome clear and loud and crisp .The display of this device Is HD Plus but trust me the panel of this display is very high quality so you will enjoy multimedia in this device..Some Cons I feel about this device first of all is display- yes this is HD plus display in this price not even full HD resolution but overall best panel used in this device so the colours are awesome but resolution is low. Second is battery - you get a 3095 mah battery which gave me a full day battery backup with normal using , If you are using an android device with 5000-6000 MAH battery then you really need to think about this device otherwise great backup because I was using a Nokia smartphone earlier which was giving me full day battery backup so I don’t have any issue with this battery..So This Is My Experience With This Device I Like This Device and I Am Very Happy With My Purchase , Thanks To Amazon’s For Delivering Me This Great Beast .',\n",

Yes there is some heating issue but that went away after i updated it to ios14 and minor tweaks here and there..BATTERY LIFE.I am not a very heavy user so it runs me for about 1.5 days, it would vary upon usage but it would last you for one entire day for sure.BACK CAMERA.I loved it but am quite disappointed with the front camera.OPERATING SYSTEM.Ios really makes life so so easy there are so many small small features that apple might not market about but it makes your life so so easy. Its experience is way better than android. I was myself a stock android user but seeing the flexibility with ios, you might not ever switch back',\n",

I don’t have to say about the camera as it is best in class. Battery backup is great in comparison with iphone 12 - you can get a full day with moderate usage. If you are heavy gamer then you may need to charge it twice a day , and my suggestion is to get a fast charger in this case as the current 5w charger takes 2-3 hours for a full charge. My suggestion is to buy it from a retail store (however the chances of a faulty product is nil) as it is costly affair and the return policy for apple products is not that great on Amazon, please check return policy before buying it online.',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  10 months ago.i've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Worth buying! It’s an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it’s more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!.What I say is don’t compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile..',\n",

Need to buy a separate fast charger, charging time is damn slow with the regular one.3. Feels Bulky and heavy in hand.4. IPS lcd panel with retina HD resolution but screen quality not that bad (No amoled, No FHD), but considering the competition amoled should have been there..To summarise its a great phone with amazing cameras with some cons but would surpass many android smartphones in performance and camera department in this price bracket!',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing..Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice..There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its  better to avoid iphone dual sim models..The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software &amp; camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.\",\n",

I booked online appointment at Service Center and taken the phone there. Service engineer tried to repair it but failed and they have replaced my old phone with new phone without any costs. Phone is working very smoothly and it’s very fluid in working. Battery lasts for a Day after full charging in morning. Camera is excellent. Overall phone is very good.',\n",

Its showing I'm eligible for replacement but they still are not replacing my product. It's a new iphone 11 and from the start it's not working properly. It keeps restarting every 2-3 minutes. I have done all the troubleshooting with the apple support but still they are not replacing it. Worst Amazon experience ever.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I bought this phone on 15/10/2020 .... the Battery  life is pathetic within month the battery health is become 98% and within 2 months 15 days the health became 95% the  the battery Health life  reduction progress is very high ...when I tried with apple I care they saying it’s very normal they have nothing to do  with this ..... simply they saying till 80% it’s normal ...... my question  to apple it’s is 99% also  normal and 80 % also .... is it so .... how can it be .... the average is not matching ..... no matter the the how  much old device is within a month they battery become 90% also they saying it’s normal ... I feel the apple quality have gone down...... they are Clear with what Parameter they following on battery issue ... in apple site they have mentioned 80% 500 cycle ..... if my battery keep on draining I need to charge my phone they obviously  i will meet the 500 cycle ... then they will say the cycle time reached so need to change the battery ....note in this entire usage on my phone i did n play games and the camera usage is very minimal max 50 photo I would have taken',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone.

       " \"<span>\\n  The reason why I am writing this review is some people received fraud product. I brought this too at Amazon's great Indian sale and got the right one. Its authentic and I got it checked online by just providing my ime number to apple. Delivery was on time. I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product. Speaking about battery life you should buy a 18watt fast charger either through apple store online or through third party companies such as anker. Slightly less battery backup can be compromised by fast charging.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  First of all there’s no fingerprint sensor in this, which could be an advantage for some and a disadvantage for some people too! One thing you need to note that during this pandemic (COVID-19) you can only use passcode as the only way to unlock your phone (of course while wearing a mask) now to the main topic this phone’s a great machine! This is my first iPhone and hell yeah I’m in love with it (also I cracked a great deal on this). If you wanna by your first iPhone you can consider this. But if you have iPhone X or above model right now and considering to buy This,then This phone’s Bazeels ( sorry don’t know the correct wordings or so) are gonna irritate you a lot! I’m gonna strongly recommend you this phone if your budget is about 50000.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Nice classy metallic finishing. Camera quality were with 12 megapixel sensor is okay but not great..Phone battery is okay gives a days life. Face unlock is some times does nt happens we need to key in the passcode to unlock the phone..Migrating data is simple from android to IOS. But migrating what's app data should be done through purchased 3rd part software. Phone consumes lots of internet compared to android. A decent phone got in discount through amazon. Amazon delivery is awesome. Customer care took my order on priority and pushed the delivery in matter of 2 days from order. Thank you Amazon team\",\n",

I ordered one from Appario Retail and other from Darshita. One red, another purple. Happy with both.',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker..Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage...Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020..Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order...The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason..But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Just opened up the brand new iPhone, after insertion is SIM card Got the call, whereupon got shocked to see that the screen is damaged from left side and there are grey/white spots as are visible on the screenshot taken by me. Customer care says we are helpless in exchanging the same since the Window of 7days has expired. It’s cheating, fraud and really unimaginable from the AMAZON.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month &amp; these are my findings:.1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs..2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots &amp; low light shots &amp; front facing camera is also good..3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don’t work in angles..4. Display size is good, &amp; fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen.5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour..6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover &amp; tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case).7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  It’s one of the most loved phone in the world. Excellent build quality. Great collaboration of software and hardware. Ultra high speed. Excellent camera. Extra ordinary security of personal data due to strict apple policy...Price has been reduced drastically after launch of iPhone 12. What else you need in the phone?',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  At first glance product as expected but when it was received the packaging was worst. It was simply put in amazon plastic packet  without any bubble wrapper or thermocal despite of pre paid of Half a lakh rupees. Amazon India must see into proper packaging system.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I paid through Amazon hdfc credit card they mentioned bonus offer &amp; instant discount, I contacted customer care they said it will be credited within 3 days, after 3 days I contacted again they said this product is not eligible for bonus offer.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  This phone is awesome. There are lots of features which are nice..Face ID can be detected even in the dark. Battery backup is nice. Phone camera automatically adjusts to take high quality pics and the night mode is fantastic. However, I am not really happy with the front camera for taking the pics at night(May be I am not using all the options for the night mode,.I need to learn more on that)..Screen is responding very well on the feathery touch. I am already an iPhone user, so all the other best features of iPhone are already here..Last but not the least, I would like to thank the seller for the genuine product and fast delivery with hassle free exchange. Seen the reviews about this seller, I was bit scared but my friend also got the iPhone from this seller and now I also got it. There is no problem with this seller.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Never buy such costly products from amazon. They never return it back if the product is defective or even it’s not working. I brought this iPhone 11 and found there is a small foreign particle inside its display. Amazon asked me to get it checked in Apptronics and apptronics people are not even ready to touch the phone as it is not purchased from apple store. Now I’m using the same defective device. Got a good lesson- Never buy any product above 5000 from online shopping websites.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I\\'ve bought both iPhone 11 and OnePlus 8T. Found OnePlus 8T to be better. 8T has better software, charging speed, battery life etc. despite being cheaper. On 11 i faced a bug in app store because of which i wasn\\'t able to install any app. The bug was error message \"this apple id has not been used in itunes store\" shown in loop. Found a workaround for this bug after spending much time and effort. (I\\'m on Linux so accessing iTunes wasn\\'t straightforward.)',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  First of all, I was so scared and confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative reviews but still, I took a chance and I’m so glad that I made the right choice. I was upgraded from iPhone 7 and it was a great experience with all the latest specs and great battery performance. I have been using it for almost 2 months. There is nothing to question about quality or any kind of issue. I love this green colour as I wanted to go for some different color. Thanks to Amazon and Seller for providing the original product with great condition.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  So here's the review after 3 months of use, this is by far the best phone i have ever used, this is my first iphone and the experience so far is truly amazing! The battery life is good, can last at most 8 hours with minimal usage and at least 6 hours with heavy usage! Although the charger is bit slow, takes almost 3 hours to charge the iPhone completely! The user interface is really smooth and if you are switching from android to ios, there's a huge difference! The camera quality is very impressive. The face id works really well. The speakers are great and earphones are durable ! You can go ahead and buy the product even now and won't regret it ♥️\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Amazon did its work pretty well.The product was delivered one day prior.I was quite happy.Coming to the phone.I was an android user who currently shifted to iPhone 11 and IM TOTALLY LOVING IT.It's a whole new world for me.The camera is top notch.Face id recognition is above expectations.Everything is soo good.The only con of iPhone 11 is the battery life.It takes more than 2 hours to completely charge to 100%  and it exhausts quickly as well.If this aspect of iphone 11 is taken care of by the apple store then there is no one that can beat iphone !!\\n...\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  LIKES +.:Everything like a flagship.:Battery is awesome.:Responsive touch and charging is good even it is 5V.: performance is mind blowing..Dislikes.: so far i don’t have problems as a customer ; but i feel Amazon fba needs improvements in packing and handling as the box was having some dents such luckily didn’t damaged the box contents',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Product is good as it’s an apple product, not much satisfaction with the seller as I ordered ones the money was deducted from account, in two hrs time I got a msg that need to revise payment as they have some issue , so I did so , twice the amount was deducted and the support system for cancellation of one order is really disappointing, I got both the phone &amp; found really different to return one .',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Online show ipods with this phone and delivered earphones...what is the reason behind this rubbish thing',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Good hardware at a decent price. The ios 14 is a good addition but no finger print scanner especially in such situations where masks are the new normal its stupid even with sophisticated ir systems for face unlock just dont sit right..Other software and hardware performance  are at par or better than many flagship androids but nothing out of the ordinary..As far as Software features and customizability goes Android is the clear winner.The Apple software seems quite restricted in a way...Overall a decent purchase...Shipping and packaging were excellent by Amazon as always. So no issues there.',\n",

Few applications struck during operation and I need to forcefully close it to come out of that app. It’s happening  from first day....feels weird after spending 60k.Camera - it looks normal as compared what apple claims..Headphones- poor quality, I have used I phone headphone in past &amp; their quality is much better than what I have received. Wire quality is pathetic. Even Rs.700 senisser quality is much better...Charger- similar to headphone they also seems pathetic, so thin &amp; delicate that you will start doubting about their life...Charging time- it took almost 3.5-4 hours tafri complete charge &amp; just 2 hour to completely drained out if you are using in continuous...Still I am looking for more clues so this phone feels me genuine &amp; worth of my spending',\n",

The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with. Night Mode is a welcome addition. its good for gaming as well. No lagging or latency while playing high graphic games. Th only disappointed is that the phone does not come with charging adaptor . we have to buy 18w or 20w charging adaptor for fast charging.

Think twice if you’re making switch from android, coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you’ll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except. It gives you 1 and half to two days  of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated.

       " '<span>\\n  I had my doubts before buying iOS product because I’ve been using Android for a very long time, I’ve stock android experience so I know what kind of difference does it make from android to iOS...- iOS is real smooth! If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it’s gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps..- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids..- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you’re not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you’ll still find a quality sound!.-  About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it’s wonderful..The Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there..Camera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive..Though zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image..- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%..PS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life..- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good..- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021..- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it’s own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better...At the end I’d Recommend this. Even if you’re switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Not much has changed. Apple has similar products but then obviously the bigger screen, better front camera and better battery life make it feel like an upgrade. The phone speaker is amazing and LOUD, especially compared to 6S. Rear camera is almost similar to 6S. But overall, I really like the phone. The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you’re a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.',\n",

The only grievance I had was of the delivery because I received it in a time span of 13 days. Took too long to deliver.. but it was worth the wait!!!! I love my iPhone 😍😍 and the delivery guy was so good that he told me to unbox the phone infront of him so that if there is any defect he could sort it out then and there itself.

If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I  have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.\",\n",

Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me..It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t..To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm..To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!.So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal..It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it..Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say..You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life..The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable..Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic..So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals..And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it..The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone.\",\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 &amp; S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge..The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  An awesome phone from Apple. Worth buying!.Camera Quality is undoubtably the best in outdoor ! Indoor seems to be good, not great...Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery...iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!..White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Honest review after using 2 months..Its the best Iphone version I have ever used..Everything is superb.Including battery backup, camera, sound quality ..I loved it..And thank you so so much Amazon and the seller as well..Loved it Amazon ❤️',\n",

If you ignore the price tag (although I bought this iPhone 11, 128gb  during the shopping festival on Amazon), iPhones are the best mobile phones on this planet. Great performance, great battery life, great camera and a great iOS..Well about this iPhone 11 everything is just great and I am happy to have one.',\n",

I have ready many bad reviews for the product and was afraid of the same but got it without any defects and its working as expected . I got my 128 gb at a good price on the big billion day...There was no hassle in the exchange as i have opted for it by giving my old iphone 7 for this one and the executive was professional where my phone had a scratch on the body but they have taken it as the screen was clear and perfect.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Best deal on iPhone ever I guess...Pros :.Best camera , even low light photography is good..Buttery smooth performance ( people talking about 90 Hertz / 120 Hertz refresh rate on androids, it's far better than those), androids I don't think can match apple's ecosystem anyday....Battery performance is a big upgrade over previous models like xr , X's etc.. can get u a day  easily...No lags no glitches..Cons..But heavy.Display is not OLED like s20 plus etc..Getting it for 46200₹ was the best online purchase I ever did..no regrets.Worth every penny.. Thanks apple and Amazon for this wonderful product..\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Well I am first time iphone user and yes it's very annoying if u r android user for first few days and ofcourse u will not regret buying IOS..Over all building quality is top notch,camera is excellent. And battery backup is also good for regular usage and don't play games on it. Yes daily usage such as fb,insta,net surfing will not consume much battery I charge battery after 2 days when its gets completely discharge and annoying is charging takes around 3 hrs to full as it comes with 5V chargers.Rest everything is nice\",\n",

       " '<span>\\n  experience is great for now.. however another feedback is that within 20 days I noticed a tiny crack like a hair on my iPhone 11.. Honestly it has not fallen yet although my previous iPhone 6s survived many drops with no cracks at all even after 4 years.. strange and surprising that the glass quality is very bad as compared to the old phones',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment..If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you..Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !',\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  Overall phone is excellent. You can go for it...But one suggestion to all, don't buy any products using Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, you will be charged nicely. That too if you are choosing NO EMI COST option then gone case, get ready to pay extra charges including interest charges and GST against each installments and products. Whatever they show in calculation details (Structure) all bullshit. I nicely charged for this product by selecting EMI option and just to save 1000/- I paid extra 2000/- for this product...And I purchased one more product 'Hoodie' the cost was 799/- by using Amazon Pay ICICI Card it costed for me 942.82 including GST even though it was a one payment...So my sincere suggest don't use *Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card at all*. And don't go for any EMI options its better to buy in one payment to avoid additional charges. No body will help you once it is charged to you. ICICI Customer care they play very safe game.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Good one..actually i was very frustrated when i order because most of the comments where discouraging and i became very tensed...but after receiving the package i am really happy because it is the best and i qm really happy about the product..😍 i was using iphone 6 and now updated to iphone 11 so comparing with iphone 6 verything is best according to me..camera quality battery life everything...go forward for this and all the best...',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I am an android user before and this is my first ios device. Before i wondered why people are spending their huge money to buy it, but now i realised why, let me tell u....Camera:.Better in bright light conditions.. but it is not upto the mark in low light or night conditions....Battery:.Which is best and lasts whole day with above avg usage..The functionality and apps handling is flawless and i can say that no one gonna regret by choosing this phone...My mobile was iphone 11 64 GB.And i would like to thank AMAZON for great delivery on time and at this situation as we get so many fake or clone iPhones which i was bothering about.. but AMAZON did a great job and got a brand new original iphone!.Thank you and go for it....',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Upgrade to 11 from 7 was smooth as the data transfer took place in just a few minutes. Features of iOS14 and the battery backup are simply superb. However, since the adapter supplied is of 2W, the charging time is higher. May be wireless charger or 5W charger should be bought separately',\n",

IDK why other users have issues with this retailer..Deal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sure..Don’t worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the market..Colour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for me..The only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can’t transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device...Hope my review helps in decision making!\\n.',\n",

If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options.

Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift...I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update...Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned..Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption..Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase...Owning a iPhone is a dream for many.

       " '<span>\\n  Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11...Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome...Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd...Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones...Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app...Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box...Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship...FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone...Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me...Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.\\n.',\n",

I called apple service centre multiple to get some help on this.but they could not help and finally i visited Apple service centre and they again formatted my phone and told me there was software issue and now this issue will not happen. Again after 5 days my apps got uninstalled. I regret buying this phone.',\n",

Everything seems paid in IOS but need to find a way 😅..You'll notice the LCD screen only when you're comparing it with another OLED phone otherwise it's display is Okay!!..The stereo speakers are fabulous, even the earpods sounds amazing..I would also like to tell the people who kept saying they got fooled by Amazon, they didn't got Airpods as it was mentioned...my dear it was already mentioned Earpods and not Airpods, there's the difference between Ear and Air. Apple calls the normal Earphones as Earpods and the bluetooth one's are called Airpods...Will update after a month of usage.\\n.\",\n",

The face id works butter smooth..5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly..6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices..7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this..8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg..9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone..10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation',\n",

If u have a budget just go for it, You won’t regret it..Coming to iPhone 11 it’s the most affordable of the lot and feels really premium. Though it’s not 5G but it doesn’t matter 5G won’t be coming anytime soon and even if it comes it would be very expensive so one can easily go for it. Coming to the lcd screen trust me won’t notice any difference it’s Apple quality LCD and the company would not compromise on quality. Camera is best especially in the low light performance is really impressive. And coming to the battery life it’s really impressive on moderate uses u can easily get 8+ hours of screen on time.',\n",

Check out some photos that I have clicked..2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge..3. With the power of Apple’s A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well...Cons:.1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display..2. Bezels are thick and looks old fashioned..Apart from these I don’t feel there are any concerns.\\n.',\n",

I have used a different charger on my iPhone 11 and its charging properly. I request you to please send provide me a new charger.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Superb Performance..A13 Bionic is a 7nm-based processor that Apple claims delivers the fastest CPU and GPU performance in a smartphone. There is no denying that the iPhone 11 feels extremely fast and buttery smooth in pretty much everything from launching and running games to browsing social media apps.\\n..',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Am gonna divide into pros and cons.Pros:.Great camera.Excellent software experience.Stereo speaker have depth in audio.Smooth animations.Battery can last upto 1 day if you are a causal user.Lag free gaming.Ip 68..Cons.Display 😖 though you won't notice it but if you pixel peep you can certainly find difference..No fingerprint sensor. I feel fingerprint authentication is more convenient than face scanner..Huge notch feels outdated..Charging takes one eternity XD...Verdict.If you want a phone for long term usage then you can go for it but if your priority is better display and better charging speed better go with OnePlus or some other devices. Rest be assured 5g won't come soon in India. Still I think it's better than iPhone 12 considering price.\\n.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Phone design and build looks premium. Camera quality is excellent and night mode works really well. Battery life is awesome lasts for a day or little more than that on moderate usage...Pros:.Battery life.Security - I moved from android so I can feel the difference.Face ID - works even on pitch dark environment.Best processor A13 Bionic.Best camera..Cons:.Display could be been Oled or amoled. It’s just Liquid Retina display..Other than that excellent device to use. Can feel the performance without any lags what so ever.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can’t be beaten by any other device. It’s really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  After using it for around 10 months, now I’m giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don’t want to shift to an Android device. I don’t gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you’re addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it’s like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:..- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone..- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%...There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with \"M\" its a new phone, if its either \"F or N\" its refurbished or used device...The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it\\'s all good for me.\\n.',\n",

The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue...Cons:.I didn’t believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it’s Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it’s a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It’ll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it’s extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I’m always wearing a mask and cannot face id...Overall it’s a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better...EDIT: After 1 year of usage, this isn\\'t a phone it\\'s simply an inconvenience, and the worst RAM management ever, once your phone is full with media, it\\'s close to impossible to transfer photos to a HD or a Laptop it keeps on giving errors, I\\'m trying for months, and so it\\'s full, the apps continuously keep crashing and phone heats up a lot. I wish to use a huge hammer on it, and if that Steve Jobs wasn\\'t dead already, I\\'d be after him to not kill but torture him the way he\\'s doing me. DO NOT R.I.P. newb.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I've used more of Android phones in my life and I was using the Pixel 3a since the last 2 years, but everything fades to the beauty and smoothness of an iPhone.

The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12’s)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn’t need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.',\n",

I would definitely recommend!\",\n",

       " \"<span>\\n  They say 'the Worlds best phone' don’t need any reviews. But still, I would like to share my experiences...I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,.It was delivered on time..There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, in-fact, I am happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy &amp; feels rich. White color does stand out professional..I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200..This phone is super smooth, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date..Camera is another best thing of iphone 11..Talking about the design and build quality, it is great. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd..Apple have improved the sound &amp; audio quality as-well. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear..Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer. Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  At first I was very afraid of ordering an Iphone from Amazon as many have very bad reviews like “given used phone”,”defective item”,etc. Still took thr risk to order it from this seller. FORTUNATELY I WAS LUCKY TO GET A GOOD PIECE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.An important note which i always follow is that whenever u get a package from amazon delivery boy -DO CHECK AND OPEN IT INFRONT OF HIM”many a times i have seen tweets that even u have the video of unpackaging they refused to take the order if some things are not right..Now regarding my views on Iphone 11 in a single word -“AWESOME”....Liked the elegant design and top notch features .',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Premium feel. No words. Just awesome, but only issue is bit overheating while charging the phone. I am using 20W charger. I was bit afraid that i might get a soap bar but thankfully i did not..Note: My goodness this ecom express delivers very very late. Should have delivered fast.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Good when comes to camera and ios experience, but when comes to video clarity on YouTube, it is pathetic..even a 15k worth mobile will give a better experience...',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I have upgraded from my iPhone 7 to 11 after 4 years. I have seen tremendous difference compare to 7. Battery life, Camera, Faster reading Face id, and bigger screen and other additional features. Everything going well. Mobile got delivered smoothly. Performing well. I am reviewing after 24 days I got the mobile everything going well.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Have been a Sony fan for more than a decade. Since Sony does not sell its phones in India, had to pick this one. This phone lacks the notification LED on the front. You need to turn the phone on to look for anything you have missed when you were away from the phone.  No fingerprint sensor.  No smart dial or i am yet to explore the option. The earpods which came with the phone is all plastic and not useful for long hours of music. May be they are made that way.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I am very much disappointed with my payment I have chosen for EMI mode but since full payment has 1000 discount I opted for full payment now I can see the full amount with no discount has been deducted I have rated 4 start because I am not sure if I should mention this over here..May be whole lot of confusion due to complexity of payment they created.....',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Everyone talks about the good points like camera, battery or looks. I would focus to the bad points I found. It depends on the buyer who will refer what before investing..1. This phone has no fingerprint scanner..2. The camera app must have some exclusive features..3. The phone migration feature was troublesome for me.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  soon after removing the film from screen I noticed a slight scratch on the screen. This should happen if the product is directly sold from the Apple store. I think it was returned or reboxed item. The film from screen wasn’t aligned properly and has bubbles with dust in it. I got so disappointed after seeing this...Please don’t purchase from online if Apple Store is available in your city or purchase from Apple.com',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Bought it for my husband. All’s good except signal reception. I don’t face any problem with my iPhone 12 but my husband faces those issues in iPhone 11. He wasn’t having any signal troubles while using his previous phone which was Android.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Writing this review after one week’s usage - iPhone 11 (White) - 128gb..1. What the most I liked about in this iPhone 11 is the Battery life: Battery lasts for 2- two and half days after its fully charged, even if you are using hotspot, wifi, bluetooth, listening music, battery was still 28% and still running smoothly. Which is far more better than Android Phones...2. Prefer buying back cover that covers your camera as well, to avoid scratches in it in future.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you’ll face no problem there...Screen response time is very accurate there’s no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you’re not getting a charger from now it’s not bad...When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can’t enjoy  it in 720p screen but it’s there...So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it’s around 55k so definitely if you’re going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Another great product from Apple. Took a long time for me to decide on the colour and the model but finally decided to go for 64GB in  black colour..The face recognition works well even in darkness without issue. Being an average user, I am able to get the battery for the 2nd day after full charging. Both the front and rear cameras are superb and professional to use with extensive features. Lot of intelligent features were considered in the IOS 14.2  and it all works fine in this model. The spatial audio produces clear sound with Dolby Atmos. The power charger and wired earphones were no more provided by Apple in the package and they encourage to reuse existing ones from old iPhones. Got the phone delivered by Amazon on same day in a good condition. Overall this is a great phone and one can go for it confidently and buy from Amazon.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  So I bought iPhone 11 128GB variant. As expected of Amazon delivery was on time and product was in excellent condition..But when I put sim inside and tried calling, distorted noice came through speaker..Calling speaker is busted. Cannot hear clear voice unless you connect earpods and worst thing is there is no replacement policy for this. Only refund..Did not expect such service from Amazon.Delivering faulty pieces..Hope this didn't happen with other customers as well.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Being my very first iOS device after using android for a decade I would say that Its a really nice device with amazing features and a top notch camera..The A13 Bionic chip takes care of all the multitasking and heavy apps like cakewalk. Battery life is unexpectedly good as compared to the previous models. Overall its a good device to go for in this price range.',\n",

One main advantage of iPhone is no heating issue like android devices. Very smooth display. Comfortable to handle in one hand. iOS 14 upgrade is feel great experience. I suggest to iPhone to sale in India with same cost selling in other countries. Surely no one can replace you in market.',\n",

Great battery life with such faster face recognition.

       " '<span>\\n  As everyone says iphone never hang, thats true! After using iphone i think you will not use android. Iphone 11 battery also good. It give me 2 days backup. Only disappointment that phone doesnt come with charger and you need to spent more 2k',\n",

I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I don't think there should be a review because people who want to buy this phone must have gone through all the bits of its features. Just one thing, that is my opinion, for a price of 50k, Apple could have given an OLED display instead of an LCD.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  This is my first iPhone, my experience is not good as  there is so much screen problem like the display not responding while talking on phone or doing something on phone..My request is to get it replace my handset as apple is also claiming to get it replace until the phone manufactured till May 2020, but my case is border line my phone manufacturing date is between 1st to 7th June 2020, would like to inform the distributor to put these cases to apple and get it replace as soon as possible as I’ve spent alot on this purchase.',\n",

Camera quality is very good before buying I’m bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven’t played game coz not a fan of games and all. Battery backup is also decent. Only drawback i see is that at this huge price only 5w slow charger is provided',\n",

That is,it stop working after 2 weeks.I don’t know the problem behind it.It suddenly stops working and so i have to buy another charger again.Without that the phone is awesome.Good system,good camera as expected from apple.Overall good phone and i recommend to people who are huge fan of apple brand.',\n",

Video editing, High end Games etc.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  This is one of the simplest reviews I’ve ever had to write: the iPhone 11 is the phone most people who are upgrading to a new iPhone this year should get. It’s an excellent phone, with one of the best cameras I’ve ever seen on a smartphone and terrific battery life. Apple’s also dropped the price by 50 bucks, Delivery speed of Delhivery courier is awesome',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  It takes 4hours to charge and 5-6hours running time. Present time nobody can wait 4hours just to charge a phone on airplane mode otherwise bot phone and charger can overheat. Not so satisfying charger and battery. So many brands are far ahead in the same price. Color is light lemony instead of yellow.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The phone is great. Seamless performance, amazing camera and good battery life considering that this is an iphone. The display is great even though it being a 720p lcd display it looks better than most oled displays. The only con is that the colour black is not exactly black its a weird shade of grey I’d recommend purchasing any other colour other than “BLACK”. Last but not the least Amazon was just brilliant at delivering the product, got the phone on the same day.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Extremely happy with IPhone 11. Bought it at 50,000 during Amazon Sale. Battery and Camera are far better than the earlier model. It is a blind buy.',\n",

I love the camera, battery life and simply everything... it looks cool... everything is working fine haven’t registered for esim though... Amazing according to me not sure about android users but iPhone users will find it amazing.... still this pack has the normal charger but apple has released new one with type c... only drawback I found',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The iPhone 11 is all round premium smartphone for millenials. The photos are good in low light conditions. Well the little 5 watt charger takes long time to charge the battery. I would suggest you to go with the 12 watt USB adapter sold seperately.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Being a middle class family I bought iPhone 11 with facing a lot of problems, waiting for almost 2 years by doing part time jobs But definitely it’s worth of money , camera is damn sooo good and performance is really really smooth and it’s battery performance is quite good ..Literally I don’t have words to explain how beautiful it looks and for its performance , it’s just perfect it’s worth of money , THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON FOR AMAZING SALE AND GIVING ME OPPURTUNITY TO BUY MY DREAM IPHONE IN SUCH A HUGE DISCOUNT .',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Like the build quality of phone, camera and battery life and of course the OS..But what I can observe in last 15 days of use, the screen with lots of scratches. Didn’t expect this from Apple and the cost of phone. Apple mention it’s a strong glass but It can get easily scratched. Guys buy best quality screen protector with this phone.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Bought the green iPhone 11 for 50 in Oct 20 for 50k. Had missed the sale as did not find a 64 gb version in green colour then. The phone has lived to its expectation so far. Buttery smooth OS, excellent camera and most iOS apps have that sense of stability and reliability in them. Assurance to privacy has been another reason for switching over to iPhone..Face ID does give trouble once in a while and does not unlock the phone..Strongly recommend upper mid tier phone.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I think no need to mention in brief 😂😂😂 as it's a iphone but battery backup is very gud I get whole day I use for call social media n playing games n camera quality as usual osm but struggles in low light a bit n face unlock in oms in any condition overall osm .\",\n",

       " '<span>\\n  There is some lag in the processing speed, the phone got hang sometime also,  there is a software update require may be because of that or something I don’t know,, but overall experience with my first iPhone is good..But still system lag sometime',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The best thing I like about it is it’s camera and performance.Privacy is no doubt the best.But it’s battery capacity is a bit low and it got discharged in 6 hours only if used continuously.The smartphone also has a heating issue.Otherwise This iPhone 11 is a beast.I got it for 55k only so I will say that in this price the smartphone is best.If you are looking for a better premium smartphone then don’t think just go for it.The delivery was also very fast. I got it within 4 days.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Got new phone today and noticed a black patch 8n the initial setup screen.it can be due to the wallpaper in the background....Awaiting apple support. And I noticed some else posted the same in the review. So is it a real issue or is this how it will appear?',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Again after android usage I am back to iPhone.Earlier I was using iPhone 4, 5 and 6 Series for a change I was using android.

The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.\\n.\",\n",

Camera is top notch especially the video quality. 4k videos at 30fps is amazing. Though the phone has only 60hz refresh rate, it is smooth enough. As always, the iOS is pretty perfectly optimised.

I got this phone during sell for ₹54999/- only with including EarPods, lighting cable, 5w charging power adapter. The iPhone is so far so good don’t hesitate to buy it.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Product is good .. but why does volum down key doesn’t reduce the volume, I mean the lateral key in the left side. Looks like software bug because on rest it works but then suddenly it stopped working',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I’m writing this review after 9 months of using my I phone! Good phone in high budget! Battery backup is not up to this mark, and now I’m facing problem in calling',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I was worried after watching some reviews for amazone service like deffective piece , clone mobiles and etc. But after getting my iphone my opinion is changed for same.it was such a superb service by amazone and great opportunity to buy this iphone in budget. Thank you amzone for ur wonderful service. Feeling so lucky .. Thank you so much. Trust worthy service 🙂',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Finally in india we are getting this at same price as in US. Since apple started assembly of this phone in india so 20% import duty is saved..I got 128 gigs variant for INR 50350 during Amazon sale with all the offers combined.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Needless to say. Very happy with the phone. Using it for a week now. In love with it. Highly recommend.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  My battery health goes down 1% in just one and half month what should I do??',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  ordered the product in sale. product is original no clone no heating issues every thing was fine is the box including charger , cable , earphones documents. i was bit nervous after reading so much of bad reviews about the  seller but hopefully everything was fine. packaging was also very properly done. good service by amazon and seller (appario retail ltd).',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  The packaging was good. And phone of course is amazing. Facial recognition isn't as awesome to be honest. Battery backup is shockingly good compared to all the Iphones I have ever owned. I upgraded from 7 to this one and it's been a good decision so far. Also, wide angle is WOW.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  It’s a super smooth functional but not user friendly. Battery life is below average. It’s only brand nothing else, you can find better ph in this price. Not happy with my purchase.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Actually read many bad reviews about the seller and product and researched many sites and purchased the product with half-heart.But the product is good as purchased in apple Store.No issues, actually we need to update the OS once received . once updates there is no issue as mentioned in the bad reviews . you can absolutely go on this product',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  If you have used iphone pro models like X, XS,XS MAX you are not gonna like it and if you are buying after 7, 8 you will like it: HENCE DONT BUY IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED AND SUPER AMOLED OR OLED DISPLAYS. the diffrence is real',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Not received correct phone.This is copy phone',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  EarPods was damaged!! I booked two phone both’s EarPods are not working properly. First time bad review on amazon frm my side',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Loved everything about this phone. For someone who is really up for a big upgrade and want a seamlessly smooth experience, you can go for it. It's totally worth it. Battery capacity is quite good. I think the greatest con will include slow charger, ohterwise all in all a great experience.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  All the right things with right amount. Camera is typical apple, impressive battery life. Feel big in hand, aluminium sides feel slippery. Smoothness is charm, powerful A13 bionic does not let you down with multitasking. Only disappointment is same 5W brick, apple should atleast give 16W charger in box.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  You know u will get awesome camera but also the battery life is quite good.Just the notch bugs me and the form factor is the thing u must consider..Rest is all good!!.Sharing some camera samples\\n..',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The most valuable product 👌 and any one want to move from android to iOS it is a great initial for you and you have to get great experience for your this product😁',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Great phone in terms of performance and battery life. Didn’t face any heating or camera issues. I must say it was a quickest prime delivery ever I have received on Amazon, I booked it at 12am and received at 9 in the morning.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Product is nice but it heat up while using.also battery life is also for around 1 day use.these are the two main problems i noticed.overall its an iphone and u know the quality of apple.a better deal.got it for around 46k on amazon festival sale.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I was waiting to buy this phone from lunch but all the time out of stock know I got the phone from Amazon thankful to Amazon this phone gift to me from my family before my birthday I always like apple phone from day one I recommend to buy this phone value for money good battery good camera thank you',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Iphone has such an amazing features, everybody will love it. It has a very beautiful camera and the quality of pics are unbelievable. Thank you so much Amazon for your discounted pricing.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I don’t need to review the phone. Nowadays we all do our research whole buying an iPhone or other expensive phones. This review is just to let tou know that I received the phone and not a stone or a soap. Just ensure that the box is properly sealed meaning there’s is a plastic wrap over the box and a sticker at the edge of the box opening.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Just go for it',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Always have loved quality of Apple. I personally feel iPhone 11 is a best pick. I loved the Camera Quality. Delivery of the product  was so smooth. Complain I have is the charging adapter which you don't  get with the phone which you have to buy from shop or online store.  Which could be waste of money. Overall I'm  fallen for the device.  Looking forward for some good pictures.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  The mobile is charging very slow. In the description it has written that the charger cable is fast. But it’s charging very very slow',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  First iPhone ever..and it's iPhone 11 ♥️ ...Everything is Awesomeee.. especially the camera .. wide angle and ultra wide angle..Stabilization is perfect than any other android phone....Mic is great..crispy..very clear with great noise cancellation..Speakers are really loud enough...It's a Beast !! 🤩. Go for it guys!\\n.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I Bought this Phone From Amazon India Sale. It has The Best camera as compared to any other android phones nd also the Weather of The Ios is different from android. If you’re are a Long Time Phone user nd changed android from to ios you can ultimately see the change that the habit of your phone using become less as compared to Android.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  Super fast delivery. Item delivered on very next day as promised. Phone recieved in sealed package and working fine for last two days. Didn't get much time to explore, however build quality and look of the phone is fabulous. Can't tell about the camera quality and other technical details as I have not used the phone much post delivery.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Better go with iPhone 11 pro or buy X R.Nothing different in between XR and 11\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Not a good by Amazon because of no cash back given at last moment, this very bed and also cheat with customer regarding cash back.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  It is an iPhone. Period. Everything is amazing. Battery life is lesser than most next gen Android phones but it is so optimized that it lasts easily for 1 day with heavy usage. Camera is top-notch and since I switched from Android to Apple, it is the little features in iPhone that surprise you.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  charger is heating very much. no support from amazon just after u get delivery. i should have bought such expensive phone from apple store only',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Buttery smooth UI. Dual speaker with crisp audio quality. Awesome camera. Face unlock. Display okayish. Its bit painful to charge with 5 watt adapter comes with the box...Amazon delivery was prompt.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  got it for rs 59900 on prime day !! In love with the cameras altogether let the droids talk iphone will be iphone !!!..(Life is not hard without one kidney)',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  This has been by far the best iphone I have ever own. The camera quality is top notch, UI quite intuitive, and battery life is OK for me. My only concern is lack of high end audio codec in bluetooth headsets such as SBC and LDAC, it supports only AAC',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Great product quality and IOS user experience. Good battery backup, sound quality and camera. Ear pod sound best in class. Only the charger very slow again : it takes more than 3h to complete charge the battery! considering long battery health  need to adjust.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  I was a fan of apple before I purchased Iphone 11 from the past Great Indian festival. After just 2 &amp; half months my charging port suddenly stoped working. Shame on you APPLE &amp;AMAZON',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  6months review...Playing codm on iPhone with high graphics and it is awesome..Battery backup as always sucks!!!.Fast charging is my dream. Purchased 20watt adapter for fast charging usb c to lighting. Still charging 1 hour for 92% and another half n hour for 8% remaining. That’s very annoying after special expenses done.\\n.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  1.Back cam is good. Front cam performs average in artificial light as well as low light.2. Display is average as compared to amoled (cause is used it previously).3. Overall good package if u don’t consume multimedia that much...4. Performance and software optimisation and back camera are the key factors',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Phone had German language installed by default and still I’m not able to completely replace it. Bit disappointing. Otherwise product is genuine and no issues so far.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Product is premium in appearance you can’t complaint about it..But the battery life is not so good..Also, there are some bugs with ios 14 which need to be resolve..Camera is fantastic even in night but wide angle camera is not good at night..Face ID is decent in response.',\n",

Trust me with this price range this is best offering from Apple...Camera: 5/5.Processor: 5/5.Battery: 4/5.Screen:4/5..Best thing about iPhone is that you keep getting updates even after 3-4  years, which is still a worry for some flagship Android phone.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Excellent product with great features which are key differentiators compared to others:.- Best design and weight.- Best camera on low light.- Best display and graphics.- Best Batery usages.Expensive became affordable, Thanks to iPhone 12 and Amazon offers.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Very easy to crack the back cover even with covers on, build quality is very bad compared to apple standards. Have been using iphone since last 5-6 years this one seems to be the most delicate of all. Take care of it like a glass item otherwise the back glass will easily break.',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I was double-minded of buying this from amazon due to some critical reviews from 2019. I placed the order following that all the recent reviews were positive and I wasn't wrong - received the brand new phone in fresh condition. It's been just 30 hours since I opened and I am perfectly happy with this. The white color gives the classic feeling.\",\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  While ordering this item it has mentioned that the box contain Ear Pods, but actually the box contains Headphone with chords. Eventually the phone doesn't have any headphone port in it. Then what should I do with that wired headphone. This is indeed unexpected from Amazon. Hope to get back an assertive response from Team Amazon.\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Good price !! I have purchased original apple device IPhone 11,through by Amazon great Indian festival offers',\n",

       " '<span>\\n  I am writing this review after use of 1month of iPhone11 and it’s really amazing to use. Canara quality is really good and face detection is too quick. With 64GB version you have to take backup regularly to get the space management but with 128GB version it’s could be easier but this is not an issue.',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Snappy performance, accurate camera In well and medium lit conditions, great premium build, excellent battery for medium to heavy use!!..Phone heats while fast charging and screen is average for price!!',\n",
       " '<span>\\n  First of all. No adapter, no earphone. If apple thinks so much about environment then why launch three four phones every year. This is sheer hypocrisy.. at least give the basic requirements. Charger and earphones are one of those.  Battery life sucks',\n",
       " \"<span>\\n  I was so skeptical and anxious with all the fraud and negative reviews. By the time I noticed high number of negative feedback, I had already ordered the phone from Appario seller as they were giving me a 2 day delivery. I got it today. It's orginal.. no flaws.. beautiful packaging. Please don't hesitate . Amazon is trusted . Hope this helps\",\n",
       " '<span>\\n  Looks amazing, features amazing, camera amazing, and most importantly the battery life. So smooth, always the best Face ID amongst giant smartphones.',\n",
